# Course diary

First I got a GitHub account so I could work with the data provided.
With the GitHub I started the IODS Project template
Then I downloaded the GitHub for desktop so I can work using Rstudio.
In Rstudy I modify the first chapter according to the instructions provided (write something about the course)
Then I modify the index file and added my name to it.
