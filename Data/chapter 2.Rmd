Data

Our original data

learning2014col <- read("C:/Users/D E L L/Documents/GitHub/IODS-project/Data")
 dim(learning2014col)
 str(learning2014col)
 
 the data have 7 variables:
 Gender: It has 2 levels: M for male, F for female

Age: age of the students.

Attitude: attitude towards statistics.

Deep: deep approach learning and it is a combination of variables including: seeking meaning, relating ideas and use of evidence. This variables measure sto what extent the student has the intention to maximize understanding, with a true commitment to learning.

Stra: strategic approach and it is a combination of variables including: organized studying and time management. This variables measures to what extent the students organize their studying

Surf: surface approach learning and it is a combination of variables including: lack of purpose, unrelated memorising and syllabus-boundness.This variable measures to what extent the student memorizes without understanding, with a serious lack of personal engagement in the learning process.

Points: the exam points that students obtained. 

for a graphic overviwe we will use ggplot2 library because it creates scatter plots and correlation value. the mapping describes the aesthetic parameters and the colour between male and female.

p <- ggpairs(learning2014col, mapping = aes(col=gender), lower=list(combo=wrap("facethist", bins=20)))

p

using this model we choose three variables as explanatory variables (surf, stra, attitude) of the dependent variable (exam points)

model <- lm(Points ~ Attitude + stra + surf, learning2014col)

model

the output shows the t values, the standart error and p values.

the model with only one variable (attitude)

model1 <- lm(Points ~ Attitude, learning2014col)

model1

residual vs fitted values 

plot(model1, 1)

normal qq-plot

plot(model1, 2)

residual vs lererage

plot(model1, 5)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
